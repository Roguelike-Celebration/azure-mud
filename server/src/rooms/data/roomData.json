The mimes stand on one side holding invisible weaponry spraying invisible bullets into the charging forces of tiny clown tanks. On the other side of the battlefield, colorful troops stand holding flowers that spray their own watery projectiles. Troops on both sides fall to the ground bloodlessly. Both sides of this battle appear to be going through the motions of the conflict without clear direction, and upon further inspection you don't seem to see a command tent present on either side. <br/><br/>To the north you see the [[Mime Warren]] in the distance. To the south, at a similar distance, you see the [[Bottom of the Clown Pit]].",

    "description": "Silence overwhelms you as you step into a canyon made of stratefied stone of alternating dark and light coloration. The canyon walls and oppressive silence amplify even the slightest rustling of cloth into a cacophonous assault on the senses, creating an unsettling atmosphere. Adding to that feeling are hundreds upon hundreds of monocromatic people standing along the edges with their hands up creating impassable walls. Some stand and move in tandem as if in conversation, others perform elaborately emotional routines depicting stories of invisible children or pets, others leap about in rapturous, but silent, joy. <br/><br/>Looking to the west you see the [[Temple of the Black and White Flame]]. On the other side of the canyon's curve it opens up to a flattened plains where you find [[The Front Lines]] of a war.",

The flame is the purest white, but streaks of black move through it sporadically, as if echoing the beating of some distant heart. Behind that flame stands the dancing image of two lovers, standing entwined but neither one existing quite in time with each other or the room around them. They shift into and out of perception, little more than a heat shimmer behind the flame. You somehow feel their presence all throughout this place. You do not know who they are, but you get the sense that they are responsible for watching over this circus. <br/><br/>To the west you see the otherworldly [[Mirror Land]] and to the east you see the monochromatic [[Mime Warren]].",

The room is full of industrial equipment rusted and corroded with time and exposure to hazardous materials, but still somehow functional despite the wear. As you examine the space, you notice a series of trash chutes in the walls, and a chittering sound coming from those chutes. At the center of the room is a deep pool of noxious fluid that you must take extreme care not to allow to touch any exposed skin. In the center of that pool you see a being who appears to be either the source of much of this sludge, or perhaps just made from similar material. The being looks at you and introduces itself as Chad of The Cloaca.<br/><br/>You notice a hole in a wall to the south that you think you can [[step through -> rebellion]].",

Moving around this space are a collection of bipedal elephants dressed in a mixture of circus attire and military garb. As you walk through you hear mutterings of discontent about circuses as a whole and you begin to realize the circus attire is worn by active spies investigating and infiltrating the nearby event for signs of animal abuse. You see medical tents and comfortable living arrangements set aside nearby, but all of it seems to be empty. Either they have not yet done their liberation mission, or there was no abuse happening and they returned blessedly empty-handed.<br/><br/>As you explore the eastern side of the camp, a fog rises around you and you suddenly appear in the middle of a [[Cloud Maze]].",

The people here clearly care deeply about the beauty of the space in which they live. You suddenly realize that you were not simply dropped into the streets, but specifically in front of a particular man. His hair is brightly-colored in a rainbow pattern, but slicked back into a more professional style, and his nose is paler than the rest of his face, as if it has been covered until very recently. Though his bearing is relaxed, you smile into the face of the King of Clowns. He nods at you knowingly, but continues on his way down the street. You simply watch him go.",

As you look down, however, you see a glass floor suspending you above an enormous sprawling mass of pipes and brass machinery. Chutes and tubes create fire and move steam in intricate patterns all ultimately funelling back into the typewriter stand you noticed before. Dwarves are scurrying to and fro, tinkering with the machines. Hooked to the typewriter is a small screen, akin to teletext, and regularly printing out game [[recommendations->getGameRec]]. Anachronistically, a cute Post-It Note shaped like a quokka is on the side of the screen, with the note \"Coming Soon: 2022 Steam Sale\" in loopy handwriting. If you'd like, you can investigate the <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/sale/roguelikecelebration2022 \" target=\"_blank\">source of its steam power</a>, or go back to the [[Guild Hall->adventurersGuildHall]].",

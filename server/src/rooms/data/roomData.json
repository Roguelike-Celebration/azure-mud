You've gone another few steps when your foot lands on a white square and a Bishop you hadn't noticed swoops in from the far side of the board and caroms into you. Ok, well, you're *definitely* not going to go back to the starting square now; you just slink back to where you were before the Bishop attack and try again.<br/><br/>Thus you make your way, in fits and starts, to the Orb, backing up to safe spaces when you encounter danger to feel out a new path.

    "description": "You have a sudden vision of archaeological dig, the sun hot above you, the remnants of ancient Babylon below. On a table in front of you, one of your research assistants has laid out a series of stone tablets. The medium was a demanding one for the written word; any mistake would be immutable, as eternal as the stone itself. The original author seemed to be working towards something, but each time made a mistake in the telling and was forced to start over. Despite this, you notice differences in each attempt; the stories, despite the same goal, diverged as the stone carver repeatedly attempted to complete their tale. \"How many tablets did we find?\" you ask your assistant. The grad student responds, \"We found 10, professor.\""

You stand in an open park between a forest of skyscrapers reaching up through the clouds, their tops somewhere beyond what your eyes can see. The upper reaches of these colossal towers sway gently in the breeze. On the ground are dilapidates benches and walking paths now reclaimed by the natural world. The chirping of some form of bird can be heard echoing among the towers, and you see bushes rustling with small animal life, though you see none of these creatures directly. </br></br>You sense within you a shift in the air. Reaching out, you can feel a myriad layers within the air, as if each glimmer you'd seen before was now a page of an enormous book that you could merely flip to on a whim. You run your fingers along the spine of this imaginary book until you find a familiar page. You know that if you turn this page, you'll appear back in the [Docking Bay -> dockingBay].",

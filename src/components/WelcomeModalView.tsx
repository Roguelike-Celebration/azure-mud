      <p>
        In the Roguelike Celebration conference space, you can only send/receive
        messages <strong>in the chat room you are currently in</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can move from virtual room to virtual room to talk to different
        people.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our hope is to facilitate smaller group conversations, to capture the feel of an in-person conference, and to give
        you a fun and playful space to explore with your fellow attendees.
      </p>
      <p>
        Happy wandering, and be wary of reading scrolls without identifying them
        first ;)
